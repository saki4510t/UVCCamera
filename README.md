How to compile library  
=========
The Gradle build system will build the entire project, including the NDK parts. If you want to build with Gradle build system,

1. make directory on your favorite place (this directory is parent directory of `UVCCamera` project).
2. change directory into the directory.
3. clone this repository with `git  clone https://github.com/saki4510t/UVCCamera.git`
4. change directory into `UVCCamera` directory with `cd UVCCamera`
5. build library with all sample projects using `gradle build`

It will takes several minutes to build. Now you can see apks in each `{sample project}/build/outputs/apks` directory.  
Or if you want to install and try all sample projects on your device, run `gradle installDebug`.  

Note: Just make sure that `local.properties` contains the paths for `sdk.dir` and `ndk.dir`. Or you can set them as enviroment variables of you shell. On some system, you may need add `JAVA_HOME` envairoment valiable that points to JDK directory.  

If you want to use Android Studio(unfortunately NDK supporting on Android Studio is very poor though),
1. make directory on your favorite place (this directory is parent directory of `UVCCamera` project).
2. change directory into the directory.
3. clone this repository with `git  clone https://github.com/saki4510t/UVCCamera.git`
4. start Android Studio and open the cloned repository using `Open an existing Android Studio project`
5. Android Studio raise some errors but just ignore now. Android Studio generate `local.properties` file. Please open `local.properties` and add `ndk.dir` key to the end of the file. The contents of the file looks like this.
```
sdk.dir={path to Android SDK on your storage}
ndk.dir={path to Android SDK on your storage}
```
Please replace actual path to SDK and NDK on your storage.  
Of course you can make `local.properties` by manually instead of using automatically generated ones by Android Studio.
6. Synchronize project
7. execute `Make project` from `Build` menu.

If you want to use build-in VCS on Android Studio, use `Check out project from Version Control` from `https://github.com/saki4510t/UVCCamera.git`. After cloning, Android Studio ask you open the project but don't open now. Instead open the project using `Open an existing Android Studio project`. Other procedures are same as above.

If you still need to use Eclipse or if you don't want to use Gradle with some reason, you can build suing `ndk-build` command.

1. make directory on your favorite place.
2. change directory into the directory.
3. clone this repository with `git  clone https://github.com/saki4510t/UVCCamera.git`
4. change directory into `{UVCCamera}/libuvccamera/build/src/main/jni` directory.
5. run `ndk-build`
6. resulted shared libraries are available under `{UVCCamera}/libuvccamera/build/src/main/libs` directory and copy them into your project with directories by manually.
7. copy files under `{UVCCamera}/libuvccamera/build/src/main/java` into your project source directory by manually.

How to use
=========
Please see sample project and/or our web site(but sorry web site is Japanese only).
These sample projects are IntelliJ projects, as is the library.
This library works on at least Android 3.1 or later(API >= 12), but Android 4.0(API >= 14)
or later is better. USB host function must be required.
If you want to try on Android 3.1, you will need some modification(need to remove
setPreviewTexture method in UVCCamera.java etc.), but we have not confirm whether the sample
project run on Android 3.1 yet.
Some sample projects need API>=18 though.

###2014/07/25
Add some modification to the library and new sample project named "USBCameraTest2".
This new sample project demonstrate how to capture movie using frame data from
UVC camera with MediaCodec and MediaMuxer.
New sample requires at least Android 4.3(API>=18).
This limitation does not come from the library itself but from the limitation of
MediaMuxer and MediaCodec#createInputSurface.

###2014/09/01
Add new sample project named `USBCameraTest3`
This new sample project demonstrate how to capture audio and movie simultaneously
using frame data from UVC camera and internal mic with MediaCodec and MediaMuxer.
This new sample includes still image capturing as png file.(you can easily change to
save as jpeg) This sample also requires at least Android 4.3(API>=18).
This limitation does not come from the library itself but from the limitation of
MediaMuxer and MediaCodec#createInputSurface.

###2014/11/16
Add new sample project named `USBCameraTest4`
This new sample project mainly demonstrate how to use offscreen rendering
and record movie without any display.
The communication with camera execute as Service and continue working
even if you stop app. If you stop camera communication, click "stop service" button.

###2014/12/17

###2015/01/22
Add method to adjust preview resolution and frame data mode.

###2015/02/12
Add IFrameCallback interface to get frame data as ByteArray
and new sample project `USBCameraTest5` to demonstrate how to use the callback method.

###2015/02/18
Add `libUVCCamera` as a library project(source code is almost same as previous release except Android.mk).
All files and directories under `library` directory is deprecated.

###2015/05/25

Fixed the issue that DeviceFilter class could not work well when providing venderID, productID etc.

###2015/06/03
Add new sample project named `USBCameraTest6`
This new sample project mainly demonstrate how to show video images on two TextureView simultaneously, side by side.

###2015/06/10
Fixed the issue of pixel format is wrong when NV21 mode on calling IFrameCallback#onFrame(U and V plane was swapped) and added YUV420SP mode.

###2015/06/11
Improve the issue of `USBCameraTest4` that fails to connect/disconnect.

###2015/07/19
Add new methods to get/set camera features like brightness, contrast etc.

###2015/10/30
Merge pull request(add status and button callback). Thanks Alexey Pelykh.

###2015/12/16
